			<h3>Instructions</h3>
			<p><i>Step-by-step instructions to create a script on this site are listed below. If there are issues or bugs, contact person.</i></p>
			<p>If you are creating a new year which does not have any scripts on the MOB site yet, click the "Add a new year button" and enter the year. This will generate the code for the link to the year at the top of the Scripts page as well as the container for the links to the scripts in that year. Copy the code snippets to their respective locations as directed.</p>
			<ol>
				<li>
					<p><u>Create a show</u>. Enter the script ID in the format shown (school abbreviation then year). This ID will connect the show link to the show itself, and must be entered in this form before completing "7. Create link to show." Enter the full name of the opposing school (don't need to go overboard though). Mark if the game was home or away. Enter the stadium or venue name, then the city and state. Enter the date of the show. Mark whether the result of the game was a win, loss, or tie, and the final score.</p>
					<p>If any of these fields are not applicable, for instance if we perform a <a href="http://mob.rice.edu/archives/scripts/#Monday_Night_Massacre">show at a non-sporting event</a>, leave the fields blank, and they will be left out of the code.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><u>Begin a script</u>. Add the title of the show, if it has one. If the show has no title, leave the "Show Title" field blank, but still submit the form with the "Begin Script" button. This will add the title if there is one and create the table the script goes in. If the game you are recording has both a pregame and halftime that you wish to record, you can use this button again after "5. Finish script."</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><u>Add a line</u>. Specify the actor of the line&mdash;the announcer is saying something, the MOB is making a formation, etc. The "MOB" option is generally used to specify something the entire MOB says or does, as opposed to individual actions by SAs or formations. Leave blank if you want to add something only to the right side of the table. Under "What," enter whatever part of the script you are adding. Repeat as many times as necessary.</p>
					
					<p>(3.5. <u>Add image</u>). This will open a separate box where you can easily add an image to the script, such as a formation or whatever is on the videoboard.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><u>Add new show segment</u>. Use this button to add a horizontal line beneath the last line you added. This generally corresponds to the end of playing a song. Repeat as many times as necessary.</p>
					<p>(4.5. <u>Add epilogue</u>). Sometimes a show might be noteworthy enough to merit an epilogue, which in the past has been used to discuss generally how the show went, any quirks, etc. Definitely optional. Do not add a new show segment before creating an epilogue. See <a href="http://mob.rice.edu/archives/scripts/#Tulane1989">Tulane 1989</a> for an example.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><u>Finish script</u>. This button closes the table which contains the script. If another script follows the first, begin it after this button.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><u>Finalize script</u>. This button closes off the entire section. Use after everything for the event has been added already.</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p><u>Create link to show</u>. Enter the title to display in the link to the show. Enter the name of the school which is most commonly identified (see table <a href="#school-names">below</a> for common schools). Enter the abbreviated date as shown in the field. This link goes inside the code created by the "Add a new year button."</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					<p>Copy all code created to their appropriate places in the MOB website code and publish. You're done!</p>
				</li>
			</ol>

			<h3>HTML Tips</h3>
			<p>This tool is programmed in pretty basic JavaScript and doesn't have many advanced functionalities. Some formatting keyboard shortcuts are available, but it's probably useful to learn a few common HTML tools to help with formatting.</p>
			<p>The biggest HTML concept you should know is called a "tag." These are the things which appear in pairs surrounding bits of text or code, such as <code>&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</code>. The tags operate on everything which is typed between them according to what kind of tags they are. For instance, using the underlining tag like this <code>&lt;u&gt;Hello&lt;/u&gt;</code> will result in the text <u>Hello</u>.</p>
			<p>Here are some common tags for formatting:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;</code>: <u>underline</u>. You can open or close this tag with <code>Ctrl + u</code> while editing certain boxes.</li>
				<li><code>&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;</code>: <i>italics</i>. You can open or close this tag with <code>Ctrl + i</code>.</li>
				<li><code>&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;</code>: <b>bold</b>. You can open or close this tag with <code>Ctrl + b</code>.</li>
				<li><code>&lt;ul&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</code>: Bullet points (like this list). Each bullet item should have the tags <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code> surrounding it</li>
				<li><code>&lt;ol&gt;&lt;/ol&gt;</code>: Numbered list (like the instructions list above). Also needs <code>&lt;li&gt;&lt;/li&gt;</code> tags for each item</li>
				<li><code>&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</code>: <p>Denotes a paragraph which is placed on its own line.</p><p>Consecutive paragraphs marked by this tag will have a small space between them</p></li>
				<li><code>&lt;br&gt;</code>: Line break. This tag does not come in a pair, and you just place it wherever you want the break to be.<br>No extra space<br>between lines here.</li>
				<li><code>&lt;img src="[image url]"/&gt;</code>: Image. Also does not come in a pair. See this <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_img.asp">link</a> for image formatting details</li>
				<li><code>&lt;a href="[url]"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</code>: Link to the url specified. Text between these tags is what the link shows up as, like above</li>
			</ul>
			
			<p>You may also need some character codes for characters not on a standard keyboard. These are created with a <code>&amp;</code> and a <code>;</code> with the code for the character in the middle. Here are some common character codes:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>&amp;mdash;</code> an em-dash (&mdash;)</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These characters need to be replaced with their codes so HTML interprets them as text and not as a command:</p>
			<ul>
				<li><code>&amp;amp;</code> &amp;</li>
				<li><code>&amp;lt;</code> &lt;</li>
				<li><code>&amp;gt;</code> &gt;</li>
			</ul>
